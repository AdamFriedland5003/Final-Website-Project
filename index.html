    My name is Adam Friedland. I did a lot this week in DMA. I tinkered with a birthday card code, made a pixel-art canvas and a calculator, and did a project related to UI design. I had not learned much about Web design before taking the Front-end Web Development class, and I learned a lot by doing it. These projects were quite interesting for me. Some of them can be viewed below.
        <br>
    In addition to working on these projects, I also learned quite a bit about the programming standards/languages we were using. We used HTML5 (an improved version of HTML), CSS, and JavaScript. HTML5 (hypertext markup language) is used for the website layout, while CSS (cascading style sheets) is used for styling and JavaScript is used for mechanics. All of these were interesting to learn, and are described in more detail below. I am very glad I was able to learn about these interesting standards/laguages and hope to learn more in the future.
